PHP RESTClient
--------------
This library provides a simple abstraction in PHP for treating resources as objects that you 
perform CRUD operations on. For example:

$resource = new RESTClient(array('url' => 'http://www.example.com/my/resource'));
$resource->post($data, $headers);
$resource->get($data, $headers);
$resource->put($data, $headers);
$resource->delete();

This API was inspired by the simple example provided in the Representation State Transfer wikipedia entry
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) and the RESTful Web Services book by
Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby (http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/).
