h1. PHP RESTClient

h2. Summary

This library provides a simple abstraction in PHP for treating resources as objects that you perform CRUD operations on. For example:

<pre>
<code>
    $resource = new RESTClient(array('url' => 'http://www.example.com/my/resource'));
    $resource->post($data, $headers);
    $resource->get($data, $headers);
    $resource->put($data, $headers);
    $resource->delete();
</code>
</pre>

This API was inspired by the simple example provided in the "Representation State Transfer wikipedia entry":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer and the "RESTful Web Services book":http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/ by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby.
